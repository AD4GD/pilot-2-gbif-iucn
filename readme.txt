These blocks are solving the task of extracting available data for potential sub(species) of interest with data from GBIF, IUCN and ancillary user-defined sources.

Output data are to be fetched in two ways:
1. tabular data with all data available from GBIF, IUCN and ancillary sources.
2. occurrence datacube from GBIF fetched for filtered or all species, converted into raster dataset regridded by the input raster file (specified by user and might represent bioclimatic variables of the study area or land-use/land-cover for the further spatial analysis).

Currently, the third step is missing (mapping GBIF tabular data and IUCN tabular data by unique IDs). It is yet to be explored through Checklistbank tools (https://www.checklistbank.org/tools/name-match-async) or by scientific or canonical names.
